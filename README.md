## **Overview of Election Analysis**

### A Python script was developed to read through the [election_results.csv](https://github.com/nabernal/Election-Analysis-Challenge/files/9689993/election_results.csv) file the election commission provided. For loops pulled candidate, county, and voter data from the file to create lists of voting information. The information was used to calculate the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout. In turn, the calculations provided the information needed to determine a winner. Formatting techniques were implemented into formulas for visual appeal. The results were then printed onto the terminal and wrote the output in a text file.

## **Election Audit Results**

### The results are based on votes made in three counties in the U.S. state of Colorado, Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe. There were three candidates Charles Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Doane. The script found that the county with the most amount of votes was Denver. The election winner was Diana DeGette, with 272,892 votes, which comprised 73.8% of the overall votes.

## **Election Audit Summary**

### This script can be edited to look at a data file for any election. For example, it can be modified to calculate how a candidate performs in a presidential election. In this instance, the county lists could be changed to a list of states and their voter information. Adding more lists, for example, state counties, to a presidential election evaluation can give insight into which counties could use more rallying in future elections.
